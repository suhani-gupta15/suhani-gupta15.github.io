Welcome to my website! Iâ€™m a student deeply interested in **astrophysics**, **particle physics**, and reducing **light pollution** in my community.

Iâ€™ve worked on projects like:
- ðŸŒ€ *Fallback accretion modeling* to explore compact object formation
- ðŸŒŒ Building a DIY **sky quality meter** to measure light pollution
- ðŸ§  Using data science and Bayesian models to analyze gravitational waves

Feel free to check out my [projects](/projects), read my [blog](/posts), or download my [CV](/assets/files/suhani_cv.pdf).
